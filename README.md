First  [WWW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web")  server located at  [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN "CERN")  with its original sticker that says: "This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!"

In  [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), a  **server**  is a piece of  [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer")  hardware or software ([computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program")) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "[clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing) "Client (computing)")". This  [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture "Systems architecture")  is called the  [client–server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Client–server model"). Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or  [resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_resource "System resource")  among multiple clients, or performing  [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation "Computation")  for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29#cite_note-1)  Typical servers are  [database servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_server "Database server"),  [file servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_server "File server"),  [mail servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_server "Mail server"),  [print servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_server "Print server"),  [web servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server"),  [game servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_server "Game server"), and  [application servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_server "Application server").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29#cite_note-2)

Client–server systems are usually most frequently implemented by (and often identified with) the  [request–response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response "Request–response")  model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgment. Designating a computer as "server-class hardware" implies that it is specialized for running servers on it. This often implies that it is more powerful and reliable than standard  [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"), but alternatively, large  [computing clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_cluster "Computing cluster")  may be composed of many relatively simple, replaceable server components.
